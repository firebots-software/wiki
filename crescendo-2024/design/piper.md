# Piper

* In order to ensure both accuracy and distance in shooting Notes during gameplay, our team made a decision to redesign our shooter/intake mechanism, formerly known as Peter. Piper was designed with both Falcon motors placed on the top and bottom of the mechanism (top-view shooter) as opposed to Peter, which had the motors on the sides (side-view shooter).

# Drivebase: We Swervin'

## Basic Drivebase Details
* Since the 2023 season, our team has been using a swerve drivetrain powered by TalonFX motors on each module. This allows our drivers to easily navigate the field as speed and agility is crucial in our strategy this season.

## What are the main features of the drivebase this season?
* As our main strategy for this year's game is Speaker scoring, we've programmed our swerve to face the Speaker, no matter which direction we move in.

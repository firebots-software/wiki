# Community Impact

Community Impact is an initiative of Fremont High Robotics to provide access to STEAM in our community through engaging, hands-on activities. Through our Torchbearing Tutors after-school lessons and take-home Kindling Kits, we have reached over 400 elementary school students in historically underprivileged areas of Sunnyvale. During our first year of Community Impact, we won the Motivate Award in the 2023 season and cannot wait to see how far we'll go in the future as our program expands. 

## Torchbearing Tutors

Over the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, our members have created, tested, and implemented 6 hands-on STEAM activities in 6 Sunnyvale Elementary School District after-school programs. From learning about bridge architecture and buoyancy to potential and kinetic energy, our activities have brought both joy and learning to the classroom.

## Kindling Kits

Introduced in the 2023-24 school year, we've distributed over 20 of these kits, which condense our Torchbearing Tutors activities as a fun, at-home learning experience. Accompanied by how-to videos filmed and edited in-house by our team, Kindling Kits are designed to provide the guidance and support of a classroom experience from the comfort of your own home.

# Wiki: Pushing Changes (AKA Publishing your work onto the offical website)

1. After seeing your changes in your local copy (check other tab if you don't know what that means) and feeling good with them, save all of your changes.
2. On VS code, click on the side button that looks like wires. Make a "commit message" and write a short description of your work. Then press commit. 
3. If your branch hasn't been published yet, publish your branch. Once you have committed,  sync all changes.
4. Go to Github and create a pull request. Create a pull request title to describe what you want to merge.
5. Create your pull request and then you wait for your assigned reviewers to look  over your code and approve it. Make sure to resolve any comments they give!
6. Once the reviewer gives their approval, then you can merge your branch into main. 

Congrats, you did it!

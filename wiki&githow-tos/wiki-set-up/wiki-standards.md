# Wiki Standards

* The first line of any article should be a title, marked with a # (e.g., # My Title Here).
* Filenames should match the title of the article, replacing any spaces with hyphens and making all letters lowercase, and should have the file extension `.md` (e.g., "Learn to Code" becomes "learn-to-code.md").
* All articles' Markdown syntax should be linted. Use the VS Code extension [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) to help with this.
* If an article contains images, put them in a folder with the name `<article-filename>_images` in the same directory as the article itself (e.g., images used for an article called "Setting up a Development Environment" are stored in a folder called `setting-up-a-development-environment_images`).

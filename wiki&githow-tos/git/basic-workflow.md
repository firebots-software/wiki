# Basic Workflow

1. Make sure you have already cloned your repository and have all necessary permissions. For the wiki in particular, see [Wiki Set Up](../wiki-set-up/wiki-set-up.md).
1. Create a new branch for your change. Make sure to follow the [branch conventions](branch-conventions.md).
1. Make your change. Each time your change reaches a nice stopping point, add a commit message and commit.
1. Once your change is ready (make sure you've formatted your code!), then do a pull request from GitHub to merge your branch to `main`.
1. This will be assigned to a reviewer automatically who will review your code. They will leave comments if anything needs to be updated. Otherwise they will approve your code.
1. You can then merge your code into main, adding it to the primary codebase.
1. You can then delete your branch.

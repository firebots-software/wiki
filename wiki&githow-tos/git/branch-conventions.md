# Branch Conventions

1. Branch names should use hyphens between words (not CamelCase or underscores).
1. Branch names should start with your name. For example, `spongebob-swerve-drive` is a good name while just `swerve-drive` is not. This will help us stay organized and be able to clean up the codebase better.
1. One branch should be focused on one feature. If you are working on, e.g., swerve drive and the intake mechanism, use one branch for each. Branches can also be more specific.

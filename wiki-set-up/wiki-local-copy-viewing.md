# Wiki: Local Copy Viewing

### It's required you view your local copy before publishing!

This helps you catch any errors!

1. Go to the team GitHub page and click on "wiki".
2. Download and open files onto VS Code, AKA clone the repository.
3. Make a new markdown file (name it like this: nameoffile.md).
4. Type whatever you need to type provided you are following the Wiki rules presented in index.html.
5. Open terminal or command prompt and change your directory (use command "cd") to the correct location with the files (you can drag the file after "cd" into the terminal to get its location). 
NOTE: If you have VS code, just open terminal on VS code and go to the next step directly.
6. Copy paste: `python3 -m http.server`.
7. Open the generated url that comes up into your browser of your choice. This is your local copy.
8. Change the name of the files in the given url to view other files.

You're doing great! :D

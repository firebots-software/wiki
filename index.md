## Welcome to the Firebots Wiki 

#### This is where we can document useful information and knowledge we gather throughout each season. The hope is that over the years, we will be able to put together a collection of helpful tips that both new and experienced members alike can draw from.

Articles are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), specifically the [GitHub-flavored Markdown dialect](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github). This provides a simple syntax for formatting articles. The wiki itself is built on [MDwiki](https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md).

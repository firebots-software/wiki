# CNC Machine Lore

## What I Want

I want a table. 

It will list different materials.

* Wood
* Acrylic
* Aluminum
* Polycarbonate

For each material, you should list ideal 

* Feed Speed
* Plunge Speed (?)
* Spindle Speed
* Z-Layer Height 

I looked into how to make tables in markdown. It's giving ascii art. Please tell me there's a better way.

## What I want (continued)

I talked to other teams at competitions. And Homestead. It seems like CNCs are the way to go. This mill stuff is real archaic. I just wrote a little document on hole sizes. It would be way cooler to just use the CNC machine. I love the CNC machine! Please use the CNC machine. Good luck!

# Hole Size Exegete

## Design Works In Mysterious Ways. Why is this page useful?

Hole sizes in CAD are often approximations, rather than exact sizes. This sucks, but it's a reality we must live with. 

I'd hope we usually drill holes with the CNC machine. But should we feel the need to go back to the archaic ways of specifically-sized drill bits, this page should let you know which bits to use for what holes. 

## What are holes used for? (completely exhaustive list as of 2023)

* Rivets
* Axles/Bearings
* Screws

## Rivets

Rivets are pretty straighforward. 

They just require a hole that fits pretty close and rivet pin will fill up the rest. 

Ideally, I'd have a table here. One column would have rivet sizes, one would have hole sizes with a Â± general error that design might give you, and a third column would have the size drill bits you could use. It would be beautiful. Unfortunately, I'm not really sure how to do that right now, and I'd have a pitifully small amount of data to input anyways. So... work in progress!

## Axles/Bearings

These are super straighforward.

Make the hole bigger than the axle. 
Make the hole as big as the bearing. 

## Screws

Screws actually have an extra column, so I'd consider them pretty advanced.

This is because there are 2 types of holes that a screw might want. 

* Through Hole
* Tapped Hole

A screw could go through it's through hole freely.
A screw would need to be twisted to go through the tapped hole.

Tapped holes take more work - you drill out the size indicated on the handy dandy chart below, and then you get the tap kit out and carve out those threads.

The chart is here. It has the screw name, things like 1/4-20 or 8-32 or m4. Then it has the through hole size, the tap hole sizes, the drill bits to use for each, all with some sort of approximate error that there might be in the drawings. 

## Talk To Design

You're going to be told to drill a hole of a certain size. If its ambiguous what you're about to use to drill it, talk to design and try to figure out what's going to go into the hole. Then make an educated decision from there. We're not going to have all the drill bits. The drill bits we have are likely poorly organized. This sucks, and it's not something we have to live with. This is a fixable problem. However, should our past patterns continue, you'll be making quite a few educated decisions. Good luck! I believe in you.
